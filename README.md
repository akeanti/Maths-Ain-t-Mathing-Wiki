# Math Ain't Mathing Wiki

## Overview
**Math Ain't Mathing Wiki** is a comprehensive online resource that showcases various mathematical theorems and concepts in an organized, wiki-style format. It serves as a digital library of theorems, complete with proofs, diagrams, and interactive search functionality. The site is designed to be responsive, engaging, and user-friendly for math enthusiasts and students alike.

## Features
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Theorems are grouped into categories (e.g., Algebra, Calculus, Geometry) with collapsible sections for easy navigation.
- **Interactive Search**: Quickly find theorems by typing in the search bar. Results filter live as you type.
- **MathJax Support**: Beautifully rendered LaTeX math expressions to display mathematical formulas and proofs.
- **Floating Symbols**: Decorative floating mathematical symbols that give the page a dynamic look.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is mobile-friendly, ensuring optimal display on different screen sizes.
- **Theorem Sections**: Each theorem is presented with its statement, proof, and accompanying diagrams where applicable.
- **Animations**: Some elements, such as theorem titles, are animated to give the page a modern and interactive feel.

## Theorem Categories
- **Algebra**: Includes famous theorems such as the Pythagorean Theorem and Fermat's Last Theorem.
- **Calculus**: Showcases the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Euler's Identity, and more.
- **Geometry**: Features Congruence Theorems and other fundamental concepts of geometry.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) for viewing the webpage.
- No additional server setup is requiredâ€”this is a static HTML project.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-aint-mathing-wiki.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd math-aint-mathing-wiki
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    or simply drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser's address bar.

### Customization
- **Add Theorems**: You can add more theorems by copying the existing HTML structure for theorems and modifying the title, proof, and diagrams.
- **Modify CSS**: To change the look and feel of the site, you can edit the styles in the `<style>` section of the `index.html` file.
- **Add Categories**: To add new theorem categories, update the sidebar structure in the HTML and create new collapsible sections.

## How It Works
- **MathJax**: The page uses MathJax to render LaTeX math notation, ensuring that all equations are beautifully displayed.
- **Responsive Sidebar**: The sidebar is implemented with collapsible sections, allowing for easy navigation on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Search Functionality**: The search bar uses simple JavaScript to filter through theorems by matching the entered text with theorem titles.
